### Hi I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer, project manager, dad, husband, and nerd. I do most of my work in the Microsoft eco-system (C#, Typescript, SQL) and in Angular. I like to figure out how things work, and how they can be made simpler and more efficient. I love to create technology that makes peoples lives better. Most of my work is on private corporate repositories, hence why my public profile is so sparse, and I have a long set of TODO items that might make it here eventually.
